# CaineBot

Caine Bot is a Discord bot for Vampire the Masquerade Tabletop. It is a program made by Nikos Fanaropoulos, a c# developer and Role Play gamer. You are free to invite the bot at your server and I hope you will enjoy it's functionality.
This bot is a product of a big passion for coding and for roleplaying and the need (for our vampire campgin) to create a single bot that will make our campaign easier.
